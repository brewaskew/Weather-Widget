Weather Widget is an app created as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.  It is a practice in using APIs and DOM manipulation.  To load the app just click on this link https://brewaskew.github.io/Weather-Widget/

The API used in the app does not come from a https source and you may have to unblock it for it to load.  Also, you can either download or clone the repo and open the index.html from your local machine (the api should load without any issues this way).
